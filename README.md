# Lightweight Game Engine

A small and fast game engine that I am writing.

WARNING: this is not in any way production-ready code. Current platform support
is very limited (Linux/X11 and Linux/Wayland are currently the best-supported
platforms, perhaps the only functional platforms).

(This project should really be called "Lightweight Graphics Engine")

## Current state of the codebase

It isn't pretty. But it can render a cube.
